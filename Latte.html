	<center><p style="font-size:35px;">A latte is more correctly known as a "Cafe Latte", though most large-scale commercial chains will make a cafe latte by default when you ask for a latte. The exception to this will be true Italian or other European restaurants, where ordering a "latte" will literally get you just a glass of steamed milk.

The milk used for the Caffe Latte is steamed and frothed to create a creamy, velvety texture that blends well with the intensely concentrated and flavorful espresso creating a harmony of flavors. The frothing of the milk is done using the steam wand of the espresso machine.</p></center>
