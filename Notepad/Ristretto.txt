	<center><p style="font-size:35px;">Ristretto is a "short shot" of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a Ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot.</p></center>
